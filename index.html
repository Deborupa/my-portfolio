            <img src="images/IMG_9998.jpg" alt="Deborupa Pal" class="profile-image">
            <p>As a dedicated Data Analyst with a Master’s in Health Informatics from Indiana University and a Bachelor’s in Health Information Management, I am passionate about harnessing the power of data to drive meaningful change. My expertise lies in SQL, Python, R, and Tableau, where I leverage these tools to optimize processes and enhance outcomes in healthcare settings.

I bring extensive experience in developing and managing databases, creating insightful dashboards, and performing detailed data analysis to identify trends and improve operational efficiency. My role at Indiana University has involved building healthcare databases and analyzing patient data to support community health initiatives, while my previous position at Kasturba Hospital focused on streamlining patient processes and ensuring compliance with HIPAA regulations.

Certified in public health and business analytics, I am committed to delivering actionable insights and advancing healthcare technology. I excel in translating complex data into clear, actionable recommendations and am driven by the goal of using data to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes.</p>
